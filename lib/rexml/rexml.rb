# 
# Short Description:
# Why did I write REXML?   At the time of this writing, there were already
# two XML parsers for Ruby. The first is a Ruby binding to a native XML
# parser.  This is a fast parser, using proven technology. However,
# it isn't very portable. The second is a native Ruby implementation, but
# I didn't like its API very much.  I wrote REXML for myself, so that I'd
# have an XML parser that had an intuitive API.
#
# API documentation can be downloaded from the REXML home page, or can
# be accessed online at http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml_doc
# A tutorial is available in docs/tutorial.html
