= Overview

This is a full git mirror of Matz' Ruby Subversion repository.
It contains *FULL* MRI history, right frem the revision 1,
including all branches and all tags.

Currently, the repository is updated manually but quite
often so that the changes are at most a few days old.

= Branches

The master branch of this repository is intentionally empty
and contains only this README.

Once you've cloned the repo, invoke 'git branch -a' to see a list
of all available branches and tags. Then just create a local
branch to track the remote branch:

git co -b trunk origin/trunk

All you have to do now is invoking 'git pull' from time
to time to get the latest updates in your branch.

Most interesting branches:

* trunk - The current development branch (1.9 dev)
* ruby_1_8   - 1.8.* series dev line
* ruby_1_8_7 - 1.8.7 maint line (bugfixes only)
* ruby_1_8_6 - 1.8.6 maint line (bugfixes only)

Typically, the changes are first done on trunk, and then
they are backported to ruby_1_8, and picked up by maintainers
and further backported to ruby_1_8_7 and in some cases even
to ruby_1_8_6.

Clearly, you could also switch to any other branch of your
interest, including ALL patchlevel tags.

Enjoy!
